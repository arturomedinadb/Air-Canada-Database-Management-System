# Air Canada Database Management System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a database management system for Air Canada. It aims to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer experiences, and support data-driven decision-making. The system is designed to streamline critical processes, such as flight scheduling, booking, check-ins, and revenue management, while ensuring data centralization and consistency.

Key features include:
- Real-time flight tracking and updates.
- Efficient passenger management across First, Business, and Economy classes.
- Integration of the Frequent Flyer program for loyalty point management.
- Centralized reporting on bookings, payments, and flight operations.

## Features of the Project
- **Centralized Information**: Reduces redundancy and ensures consistent data across departments.
- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Personalized offers and seamless booking experiences for passengers.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Analytical insights into revenue, frequent flyer performance, and resource allocation.
- **Scalability**: Designed for expansion and adaptation to future requirements.

## Dataset Description
**Entities**:
- **Flight**: Includes flight ID, number, departure/arrival times, and aircraft details.
- **Passenger**: Contains personal and contact details of passengers.
- **Booking**: Manages reservations, statuses, and related payments.
- **Payment**: Records transaction details, including amounts and methods.
- **Frequent Flyer**: Tracks loyalty points and membership tiers.
- **Check-In**: Logs boarding passes, seat selections, and check-in times.

**Key Attributes**:
- **flight_number**: Unique identifier for each flight.
- **passenger_id**: Unique identifier for passengers.
- **booking_id**: Unique reservation number for each booking.
- **payment_id**: Identifier for transactions.

## Methodology
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Defined business processes and functionalities for the database.
2. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Modeled entities, attributes, and relationships.
3. **Relational Schema**: Designed tables and defined primary/foreign keys.
4. **Data Implementation**:
   - Used SQL to create tables and relationships.
   - Inserted diverse data for testing queries.
5. **Query Development**: Created 20+ SQL queries, ranging from simple to complex, for data retrieval and analysis.

## Key Results
- **Improved Efficiency**: Streamlined data entry, updates, and retrieval processes.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Generated actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
- **Scalable Design**: Database accommodates future feature integrations.
- **User-Friendly Structure**: Simplifies access and management for staff and customers.

## Future Improvements
- **Advanced Analytics**: Incorporate predictive modeling for demand forecasting.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement role-based access control and encryption.
- **API Integration**: Enable seamless connectivity with external systems.
- **Real-World Constraints**: Include considerations for transaction costs and operational delays.
